1. Examine Sender’s Email Address for Spoofing
From: no-reply@microsoft-support.xyz

Red flag: Legitimate Microsoft emails come from domains like @accountprotection.microsoft.com, @mail.microsoft.com, or @microsoft.com—not microsoft-support.xyz


2.Check email headers for discrepancies (using online header analyzer)
Given below is the result after analysing 
Summary

The Analysis
The received path showing that the sending IP is suspicious and unrelated to Microsoft’s infrastructure.
Authentication failures: SPF = fail, DKIM = none, DMARC = fail.
Anti-phishing indicators in the X-Forefront-Antispam-Report and X-Microsoft-Antispam headers, showing categories like PHSH (phishing) and SPOOF.


3. Identify Suspicious Links or Attachments
The “Pay For Subscription” button links to https://olocierew.net/ssl?...

This domain is not Microsoft-related—a common phishing tactic to steal login credentials or spread malware


4. Look for Urgent or Threatening Language
“Subscription Expires on January 6” and “We Will Suspend Your Subscription” create unnecessary urgency, encouraging users to act fast without thinking.


5. Note Any Mismatched URLs 

Hovering over “Pay For Subscription” reveals the non‑Microsoft domain.

Display text appears Microsoft‑legitimate, actual URL points to a third-party phishing site.


6. Verify Presence of Spelling or Grammar Errors
Minor errors such as “Office_365_Renewal” with an underscore, odd capitalization/punctuation, and unnatural phrasing like “Will Be Extended from Your Current Subscription End Date.”


7.Summary
Spoofed sender address: The sender domain (microsoft‑support.xyz) doesn’t match the legitimate organization, a classic sign of deception.

Failed authentication: SPF/DKIM/DMARC results fail or don’t align, suggesting emails are sent from unauthorized origins.

Malicious link: The displayed button opens a non‑Microsoft URL, hiding the actual phishing domain.

Urgent threat language: The email pressures users to act quickly—this tactic is common in phishing scams.

Spelling issues & generic greeting: Poor formatting, grammar mistakes, and impersonal salutation raise suspicion.
