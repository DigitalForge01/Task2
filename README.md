Analysis of a Phishing Email
# Phishing Email Analysis README

## 🧪 Project Overview
This repository demonstrates a step‑by‑step analysis of a simulated phishing email—using raw Internet headers, content inspection, and authentication checks—to help users learn how to identify and report phishing.


## ✅ Analysis Process

### 1. Header Collection  
Extract and save the full raw email headers from your client (e.g. Gmail “Show original”, Outlook “View source”).

### 2. Inspect Key Header Fields  
Examine:
- **Return‑Path**, **From**, **Reply‑To**  
- **Message‑ID**  
- Full chain of **Received** hops (from origin to recipient)

### 3. Verify SPF / DKIM / DMARC  
Check if authentication passes and aligns with the `From` domain. Misalignment or failures are strong phishing indicators.

### 4. Trace the Received Path  
Identify unexpected sending IPs, geolocation mismatches, or strange routing delays.

### 5. Check Spam / Phishing Scores  
Analyze headers like `X‑Spam‑Score`, `X‑Forefront‑Antispam`, or `X‑Microsoft‑Antispam` for phishing/spoof flags or bulk-sending markers.

### 6. (Optional) Use a Header Parser  
Optionally paste the headers into tools like MXToolbox or Google Admin Toolbox to visualize routing, authentication results, and anomalies.

### 7. Combine with Content-Level Indicators  
Cross-check technical findings with:
- Suspicious links or attachments  
- Urgent or threatening language  
- Typos, grammar errors, or mismatched domains  
- Lack of personalization or generic greetings


## 🧩 Summary of Common Phishing Traits

| Trait                            | Example                                  |

| Spoofed sender address           | `no‑reply@microsoft‑support.xyz`         |
| Failed authentication            | SPF/DKIM/DMARC results: **fail**         |
| Suspicious links                 | Button URLs point to external phishing domain |
| Urgent or threatening messaging  | Claims of “account suspension in 24h”     |
| Display vs. actual URL mismatch  | Hover reveals phishing domain            |
| Grammar/spelling issues          | Underscores, awkward phrasing             |
| Generic or impersonal greeting   | “Dear User” with no username             |



## 🧭 Why This Workflow Matters
By pairing technical header analysis with content-based red flags, you gain a comprehensive method to accurately detect phishing attempts. This dual‑layered approach helps uncover spoofing, spoofed origins, malicious links, and deceptive language in phishing emails.


## 📄 Usage Instructions
1. Paste the raw headers into your preferred analyzer.
2. Review routing and authentication results.
3. Inspect links and message content carefully.
4. Document and report any phishing indicators.
5. Update or extend the analysis with additional samples.
